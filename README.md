         Each tile in scrabble has a letter, and a frequency of that tile for a total of 100 tiles.
         The exception to this are the blank tiles, which are represented by an underscore.
         Any tiles that have already been used are represented by a string of uppercase letters.

         When asked for, output the number of tiles remaining in the Scrabble back in descending order. If the number
         of tiles remaining ties for multiple letters, display the letters in alphabetical order. ie:

         10: E
         9: I
         8: A
         7: O
         5: N, R, T
         4: D, L, U
         3: G, S
         2: F, H, P, V, W
         1: B, C, J, K, M, Q, Y, Z, _
         0: X

         If an attempt is made to withdraw tiles that are no longer there, an error message needs to be sent.
